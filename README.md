# 2PCF_AP
Code using 2pcf measured from 1.37 M BOSS DR12 galaxies to do a redshift evolution AP test and constrain cosmological models.

Xiaodong 2017-03-30:
Python code roughly done (see pythonlib/Tpcftools_smuximu.py). 
Cosmological conversion of 2PCF done 
  (Dense->Sparse mapping, pixels can be divided if lying on the boundary after changing cosmology. Really tremendous effort spent before making it work!!!)
Fortran code to be done.
