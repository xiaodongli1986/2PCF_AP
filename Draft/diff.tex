The  origin  of  the late-time accelerating  expansion  of  the  universe  is  one of  the  most  salient  questions  in  contemporary cosmology. 
Theoretical explanations for this phenomena are many and range from a non-zero  vacuum energy and evolving  scalar  fields  remnant  from  the  big  bang, 
to modifications of Einstein's General Relativity\cite{2012IJMPD..2130002Y}. 
Considering the wealth of theoretical explanations, 
it is crucial to obtain precise and unbiased measurements of the expansion history of the Universe allowing us to 
differentiate between competing models. 

In recent years the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test \citep{AP1979} applied to galaxy redshift samples \citep{Outram2004,Blake2011,Alam2016}, 
has allowed tight constraints to be placed on the background averaged distance scales, $D_A(z)$ and $H^{-1}(z)$.  
Assuming an incorrect cosmological model for the coordinate transformation between redshift space and comoving space
produces residual geometric distortions in the resultant galaxy distribution (see  Fig.\ref{fig_xy}). 
These distortions are induced by the fact that measured distances along 
and perpendicular to the line of sight are connected with cosmological parameters differently. 
Measuring the ratio of galaxy clustering in the radial and transverse directions provides a probe of this AP effect.

%The BAO standard ruler method for obtaining estimates of $D_A(z)$ and $H^{-1}(z)$ is widely used and accepted by the community.
%However, since these measurements are made on large scales (~$120$Mpc), 
%they require large comoving volumes and wide redshift bins to reduce cosmic variance. 
%This results in estimates of the cosmic observables at fewer redshifts and with access to fewer Fourier modes. 
%This reduction of information hinders our attempts to test dark energy models. 

The main caveat in applying the AP test is that 
the radial distances of galaxies are inferred from observed redshifts.
Thus AP tests are inevitably affected by the peculiar motions of galaxies,
which leads to apparent anisotropy in the clustering signal, even if the adopted cosmology is correct.
The effect, known as redshift-space distortions (RSD),
is notoriously difficult to model accurately in the statistics of galaxy clustering \citep{Ballinger1996}.

The symmetry properties of galaxy pairs\cite{Marinoni2010}  could also be used to probe the AP effect;
however, since the peculiar velocity distorts the redshifts and changes the apparent tilt angles of galaxy pairs,
this method is also seriously limited by RSD \citep{Jennings2011}.

In an effort to minimize RSD contamination, the shape of void regions\cite{Ryden1995,LavausWandelt1995}  has been 
proposed as an AP probe. This approach has the advantage that the void regions are easier to model compared with dense regions, but has limitations in that it utilizes only low density regions of the LSS and requires large samples to achieve competitive constraints \citep{Qingqing2016}.

%In an effort to overcome the RSD problem, 
%\citep{Li2016} proposed to apply the AP effect to clustering on small scales. 
%However, redshift space distortions affect the angular clustering of galaxies, mimicking a signal similar to the AP effect, 
%thus contaminating the cosmological information.

Previously, we proposed to use the {\it redshift dependence} of the AP distortion\cite{Li2014} as a way of mitigating the RSD effect. The clustering anisotropies produced by RSD are, although large, close to uniform in magnitude over a wide range in redshift.  However, if cosmological parameters are incorrectly chosen resulting in an AP effect, 
the anisotropy in the clustering signal has a clear redshift dependence
(as an illustration, Fig.\ref{fig_xy} shows how the shape distortion of objects varies with distance (i.e., redshift) 
when incorrect cosmologies are used to infer distances).
In a later work\cite{Li2015}, we developed an AP methodology 
that utilizes the redshift dependence of the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2pCF), 
measured as a function of angle between the galaxy pair and line-of-sight (LoS).


In an earlier work\citep{Li2016} we applied this AP method to galaxies from the 3rd incarnation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III). 
Combining the method with measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), type Ia supernovae (SNIa), 
baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and $H_0$,
we obtained very tight constraints of $ \Omega_m = 0.301 \pm 0.006,\ w=-1.054 \pm 0.025$.
In reducing the RSD effect, 
we were able to use galaxy clustering on scales down to 6 $h^{-1}$Mpc,
which is a major advance in extracting cosmological information 
on small scales where galaxy clustering is strong and many independent structures exist.



In this paper, we continue to develop our previous methodology and proceed to infer the constraints on dynamical dark energy. 
We will present a slightly improved methodology to that of our previous work\citep{Li2016}, 
allowing for faster likelihood estimation and thus the exploration of larger, higher dimensional parameter spaces. 
The methodology we will present here, can be applied to any model of dynamical dark energy, 
or indeed any appropriately chosen parametric or non-parametric decomposition of the cosmic expansion history. 
However, as a first step, in this paper we will focus on the widely used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization\cite{CPL_CP,CPL_L},
\begin{equation}
w(z) = w_0 + w_a (1-a) = w_0 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}.
\end{equation}
This parametrization characterizes dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) by two free parameters.
$w_0$ determines the present-day value, while parameter $w_a$ characterizes the first-order derivative of $w$ with respect to $a$. 
The possible redshift evolution of dark energy EoS is not considered in the analysis of \cite{Li2016}. 

The CPL parametrization has many obvious advantages, for instance, a manageable parameter space, 
the bounded behavior at high redshift, 
and the ability to accurately reconstruct many dark energy theories\cite{CPL_L}. 
So it was widely used in the literature to reconstruct dark energy from observations.
The constraining power is usually quantified by the DETF (Dark Energy Task Force) \cite{DETF} figure of merit, 
defined as the reciprocal of the area of the error ellipse enclosing the 95\% confidence limit (CL) in the $w_0-w_a$ plane. 
Fig.\ref{fig_xy} shows that redshift dependence of shape distortion is sensitive to both $w_0$ and $w_a$.
So we expect these two parameters effectively constrained by our method.

\section{Methodology}
The spectroscopic galaxy sample of SDSS-III BOSS (Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey) has two primary catalogues:
%the LOWZ at $z\leq0.4$, and CMASS covering $0.4\leq z \leq 0.7$. %of galaxies.
the LOWZ sample, designed as an extension of the SDSS-I/II luminous red galaxy sample to $z\approx 0.4$ and fainter luminosities,
and the CMASS sample covers a higher redshift ($0.4\lesssim z \lesssim 0.7$),
targeted to be an approximately stellar mass limited sample of massive, luminous galaxies \cite{Reidetal:2016}.
In the clustering analysis we use 1,133,326 galaxies, split into six, non-overlapping redshift bins, 
$0.150<z_1<0.274<z_2<0.351<z_3<0.430<z_4<0.511<z_5<0.572<z_6<0.693$.
The number density of galaxies and the redshift binning scheme is plotted in the left panel of Fig.\ref{fig_TpCF}.

\end{figure*}

Following our previous methodology \citep{Li2016}, the information of small-scale anisotropic clustering is computed.
%\footnote{These correlations were computed using the public code \texttt{KSTAT} \citep{kstat}.} 
as $\xi_{\Delta s} (\mu) \equiv \int_{s_{\rm min}}^{s_{\rm max}} \xi (s,\mu)\ ds$, 
with $s_{\rm min}=6 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc},\ s_{\rm max}=40 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}$.
We then normalize these {\em clustering shells} as 
$\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(\mu) \equiv \frac{\xi_{\Delta s}(\mu)}{\int_{0}^{\mu_{\rm max}}\xi_{\Delta s}(\mu)\ d\mu}$
to nullify the amplitude information of the clustering signal, 
which is not associated with the Alcock-Paczynski test and is mostly sensitive to the galaxy bias.


The right panel of Fig.\ref{fig_TpCF} shows the contour map of $\xi(s,\mu)$ measured in the six redshift bins.
The contour lines are not horizontal due to the effects of peculiar velocity,
and the RSD effect clearly manifest itself through the tilting of contour lines.
However, the shape of the tilted lines remain similar at different redshifts, a fact that enables us  to mitigate the RSD effect by focusing on the redshift dependence of the anisotropic clustering signal.
The ``correct'' cosmological model is selected by minimizing the amount of redshift evolution of $\hat\xi_{\Delta s}$,
via a $\chi^2$ function of 
\begin{equation}
 \chi^2\equiv \sum_{i=2}^{6} \sum_{j_1=1}^{n_{\mu}} \sum_{j_2=1}^{n_{\mu}} {\bf p}(z_i,\mu_{j_1}) ({\bf Cov}_{i}^{-1})_{j_1,j_2}  {\bf p}(z_i,\mu_{j_2})
\end{equation}
where ${\bf p}(z_i,\mu_{j})$ is the redshift evolution of clustering with respect to the lowest redshift bin,
while subtracting systematic effects:
\begin{eqnarray}
 {\bf p}(z_i,\mu_{j}) \equiv\ & \left[\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(z_i,\mu_j)-\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(z_1,\mu_j)\right] \\ \nonumber
 &- \left[\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(z_i,\mu_j)-\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(z_1,\mu_j)\right]_{\rm sys}.
\end{eqnarray}
We use a number of $n_{\mu}$=20, 21, ... 25 bins for the value of $\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(\mu)$ at $0<\mu<\mu_{\rm max}$.
For the removal of fiber collision and the strong FoG effect near the LOS we take a cut $\mu_{\rm max} = 0.97$.

Systematics effects are estimated using mock catalogues derived from Horizon Run 4 (HR4) \cite{HR4},
an N-body simulation with box size $L={3150}$ $h^{-1}$Mpc, number of particles $6300^3$,   
initial redshift $z_{i}=100$, and WMAP5\citep{komatsu2011} cosmological parameters 
$(\Omega_{b},\Omega_{m},\Omega_\Lambda,h,\sigma_8,n_s)$  = (0.044, 0.26, 0.74, 0.72, 0.79, 0.96). 
As presented in \cite{Li2016}, the value of $\left[\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(z_i,\mu_j)-\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(z_1,\mu_j)\right]_{\rm sys}$
(mainly comes from redshift evolution of RSD and galaxy bias)
reaches 4-6\% at the highest redshift bin,
and is minor ($\lesssim2\%$) at the other redshift bins.
Mock galaxy samples are produced using a modified version of the one-to-one correspondence scheme \citep{hong2016}. 
The covariance matrix, ${\bf Cov}$, is computed from the 2,000 sets of MultiDark PATCHY mock catalogues \citep{MDPATCHY}.
The statistical bias and scattering in the likelihood function (due to the finite number of mocks in covariance estimation) 
are adequately corrected \citep{Hartlap,Percival2014}.

\end{figure*}

In our earlier work\cite{Li2016}, the likelihood contour of $\Omega_m-w$ was constructed by
measuring the 2PCF 3,375 times,
using 3D positions of BOSS galaxies computed in 71$\times$45 sets of cosmological parameters.
%with $0.06\leq \Omega_m\leq 0.41$, $-1.5 \leq w \leq -0.4$.
This procedure took 1 month using 500 cores of the KIAS {\texttt {baekdu}} cluster.
It would be computationally intractable to attempt a full MCMC of all relevant cosmological parameters using this approach. 
Thus we adopt an ``approximate 2PCF'' by transforming our measurements from one cosmology to another.
%It would be too expensive to do such a computation on a 3D grid of $\Omega_m-w_0-w_a$,
%so here we take an approach  of ``approximate 2PCF'', described as follows.

In detail, the number of pairs are only counted in a fiducial cosmology
-- which is taken as the $\Omega_m=0.26$ $\Lambda$CDM --
and ``translated'' to the measurements in a ``target'' cosmology using the relations, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:smumap}
 s_{\rm target} = s_{\rm fiducial} \sqrt{\alpha_{\parallel}^2 \mu_{\rm fiducial}^2+\alpha_{\bot}^2(1-\mu_{\rm fiducial}^2)}, \\
 \mu_{\rm target} = \mu_{\rm fiducial} \frac{\alpha_\parallel}{\sqrt{\alpha_{\parallel}^2 \mu_{\rm fiducial}^2 +\alpha_{\bot}^2(1-\mu_{\rm fiducial}^2)}}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha_{\bot}\equiv D_{A,\rm target}/D_{A,\rm fiducial}$,
$\alpha_{\parallel}\equiv H_{\rm fiducial}/H_{\rm target}$.
and values of $D_A$ and $H$ are computed in the effective redshifts of the six redshift bins.
%The left panel of Figure \ref{fig_method} shows how 
%$\xi(s,\mu)$ is mapped from the fiducial cosmology to another cosmology using the above relations.
In the fiducial cosmology
we measure $\xi(s,\mu)$ with a high resolution of
$\Delta s = 0.2 {\rm Mpc/h}$, $\Delta \mu = 1/600$,
%Let us call this ``approximate 2pCF'' method.
%to obtain the accurate number counts 
and these small ``pixels'' are grouped to infer 
the number counts in other cosmologies, 
in large pixels of $\Delta s = 1 {\rm Mpc/h}$, $\Delta \mu = 1/120$.
%in the fiducial cosmology and group the bins in the target cosmology.
In the case when one small pixel belongs to more than one larger pixel,
a correction is applied by computing the fraction of the overlapping area.
%\footnote{A dense grid can effectively reduce the ``edge effect'' produced when we map $\xi(s,\mu)$ from one cosmology to another.
%The edge effect would introduce artificial correlations between nearby pixels, smooth $\xi(s,\mu)$ a little bit, 
%reduce the value of $\chi^2$, and change the obtained cosmological constriants.
%We found that, using $\Delta s = 1 {\rm Mpc/h}$ and $\Delta \mu = 1/120$, 
%the cosmological constraints of \cite{Li2016} can not be properly reproduced.}.

We found when using the approximate method the computed 
$\hat\xi_{\Delta s}(\mu)$ in a non-fiducial cosmology suffers from
an error of $\lesssim0.5\%$, which is 10 times smaller than the statistical noise.
We checked that the approximate method can reproduce the results presented in \cite{Li2016} quite well.

\section{Result}

The Planck team has released the {\texttt {COSMOMC}} \citep{LB2002} outputs of four MCMC ``chains'' in the CPL model, 
using a combination of four datasets:
the full-mission Planck observations of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies \cite{Planck2015},
the BAO distance priors measured from SDSS DR11 \citep{Anderson2013}, 6dFGS \citep{6dFGS} and SDSS MGS \citep{MGS},
the ``JLA'' SNIa sample \citep{JLA},
and the Hubble Space Telescope measurement of $H_0=70.6\pm3.3$ km/s/Mpc \cite{Riess2011,E14H0}.
These MCMC chains contain the CMB+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$ likelihood computed for $\sim$37,000 sets of cosmological parameters,
yielding constraints of %$ \Omega_m = 0.309 \pm 0.010, w_0 = -0.938 \pm 0.109, w_a = -0.38 \pm 0.41$.
%\begin{eqnarray}
% \Omega_m &=& 0.309 \pm 0.010,  \\ \nonumber
% w_0 &=& -0.938 \pm 0.109,  \\ \nonumber
% w_a &=& -0.38 \pm 0.41.
%\end{eqnarray}
\small
\begin{equation}
 \Omega_m = 0.309 \pm 0.010,\
 w_0 = -0.938 \pm 0.109,\
 w_a = -0.38 \pm 0.41.
\end{equation}
\normalsize
%To derive the constraints combined with our AP method,
%we then compute the likelihood of the SDSS LOWZ+CMASS AP measurements for each of the parameter combinations provided in the Planck chain. 
%To do this, we splited the 1,133,326 galaxies from the SDSS DR12 into six redshift bins,
%measured the 2pCF (on scales of 6-40 $h^{-1}$Mpc) in these redshift bins (see Fig.\ref{fig_nbar}).
%This enables us investigating the redshift evolution of anisotropic clustering.
%We subtracted the systematic effects based on estimations from mocks made from Horizon Run 4 simulations \citep{HR4},
%and used a $\chi^2$ function to assess the redshift dependence.
%(see Methods for further explanations).
After adding the log-likelihoods of the Planck team sample with ours, 
while also multiply the sample weights by our likelihoods, 
we derive the CMB+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$+AP constraints on CPL parameters, %$\Omega_m = 0.301 \pm 0.008, w_0 = -1.042 \pm 0.067, w_a = -0.07 \pm 0.29$.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\Omega_m &=& 0.301 \pm 0.008, \\ \nonumber
%w_0 &=& -1.042 \pm 0.067, \\ \nonumber
%w_a &=& -0.07 \pm 0.29.
%\end{eqnarray}
\small
\begin{equation}
 \Omega_m = 0.301 \pm 0.008,\
 w_0 = -1.042 \pm 0.067,\
 w_a = -0.07 \pm 0.29.
\end{equation}
\normalsize
%While the central values of parameters do not shift appreciably,
As a result of the additional constraint from our AP analysis,
the error bars of $w_0$ and $w_a$ are reduced by 38.4\% and 29.7\%, respectively.% $$-40\%$ by adding our method into the analysis.
It can be also noted that the central value of $w_a$ moved to zero appreciably.

The marginalized constraints on $w_0-w_a$ are shown in the left panel of Fig.\ref{fig_con}.
Adding our new AP constraints significantly reduces the allowable parameter space. 
This can also be visualized as allowable bands in $w(z)$ as can be seen in the right panel of Fig.\ref{fig_con}.  

The derived cosmological constraints are fully consistent with a cosmological constant dark energy component having no evolution.
%\cite{Li2016} 
Adding the new AP method to the CMB+BAO+SNIa+$H_0$ constraints reduces the statistical errors on many parameters by $\sim$30-40\% 
and reduces the $w_0-w_a$ (95.4\% CL) contour by 50\%.
This constitutes a significant increase in the figure of merit constraints on $(w_0, w_a)$. 
This doubling of the figure of merit comes at no additional cost or alteration to data size, 
thus greatly improving the overall cost-benefit consideration of large cosmological redshift surveys.


We performed a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{thorough }\DIFdelend test of all the possible variables in our methodology.
Fig.\ref{fig_contest} shows that 
the result is unaffected by the line-of-sight $\mu$-cut, 
the number of angular bins, 
the range of radial integration and the choice of fiducial cosmology. 
%we adopt $\mu_{\rm max}=0.99\ (0.85)$ to include more (less) regions near the LOS,
%decrease the number of angular bins to $n_{\mu}=15-20$,
%change the range of clustering to $8-30 \rm Mpc/h$,
%change the fiducial cosmology to $\Omega_m=0.26,\ w=-0.6$,
%exclude 1 or 2 high redshift bins,
%or reduce the number of mocks to 1000.
The result does not change significantly if we remove the highest redshift bin,
where the estimated systematics is comparably large.
The most striking point to note in our test is that the 
shift in contour position is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{very small }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{not significant }\DIFaddend even when %we do not include the systematic correction.
the systematics are not corrected.
%This is reassuring, since we may have worried that {\it cosmological dependence} 
%of the systematic correction could influence the final result. 
This indicates that, for the data analysis of current galaxy surveys,
the systematic effects in our method may not be important.
But it remains to be seen if this is true for future galaxy surveys,
or when the cosmology dependence of the systematics effects is taken into account.


%\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\section{Conclusion}

In recent studies we have proposed to constrain cosmological parameters 
governing the expansion history of the universe via 
the redshift dependence of anisotropic galaxy clustering\cite{Li2016}.
This approach enables a robust AP test on relatively small scales.
In this paper we improved the methodology and obtained a tight constraint 
on the CPL parametrization of dark energy.
%DIF < The derived cosmological constraints are fully consistent with a cosmological constant 
%DIF < dark energy component having no redshift evolution.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The derived cosmological constraints are fully consistent with a cosmological constant 
dark energy component having no redshift evolution.
}\DIFaddend 

%using 1,133,326 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 
%12 spanning the redshift range $0.15<z<0.69$ . 
%Adding our constraints to the CMB+SNIa+BAO+$H_0$ combination, the $w_0-w_a$ contour was reduced by $\sim50$\%.

The AP method presented in this work has many advantages over the 
`traditional' methods using galaxy clustering.
Since it works with the redshift evolution of the anisotropic clustering signal it significantly reduces the effect of systematics. 
It avoids the great difficulty in accurate modeling of the RSD, non-linear clustering and galaxy bias.
%It is applicable on much smaller clustering scales, allowing for the inclusion of more $k$-modes and hence more information. 
Our method can use the galaxy clustering signal down to
much smaller scales compared to other methods,
providing much higher statistics\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
}


%DIF > Yet there are still issues demanding more investigations.
\DIFadd{In this analysis, the systematic effects and the covariance matrices are estimated using simulations performed in a certain cosmology.
Their cosmological dependence needs to be investigated in future works to guarantee the robustness of the method}\DIFaddend .


Combining our method with the CMB+SNIa+BAO+$H_0$ datasets,
the dark energy figure of merit is improved by a factor of 2.
%The method can be applied to many spectroscopic galaxy surveys.
We expect the method will play an important role in deriving cosmological constraints from future spectroscopic galaxy surveys.
